I should have included the neccessary libraries used for this project in this folder.
The rest of the libraries can be downloaded from Arduino.
As for compononents used, they are very basic and minimal since I focused more on the software side.
I apologise if I happen to miss out any of the libraries.

P.S. 
This object detection is really reliable and fast compared to other models I have worked with before, I highly recommend it!
All computing is done by Google while your PC just hosts a server to for data transfer.
As expected of any object detection machine learning, results and confidence level do vary with your camera quality.
